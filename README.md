### Hi there 👋

🚀 About Me

  I am Lazghab Rayen, a Junior Full-Stack Developer {specializing in React Application} with a Bachelor in Electrical, Electronic and Automation. I am also Pursuing my  Bachelor in Computer Science & Engineering and will graduate in mid-2024.
  
  👨‍💻 I am really enthusiastic about learning new technology.In 2020, I learned javascript and Next.js Progressive Web App (PWA). I have an interest in the Fintech       Industry and Blockchain evolution.
  
  🎲 Outside the world of tech too, I enjoy pushing myself to develop new skills. My hobbies range from video games 🎮, traveling ✈️ to camping 🔥.
  
  📚 I also love reading books on personal development & financial literacy and fiction. My favorite ones are The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck, 
  The Richest Man in Babylon and The Foundation by Isaac Assimov.
